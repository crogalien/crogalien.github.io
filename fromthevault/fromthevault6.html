                              Greetings to my wonderful family, from California
                              to Indiana to Houston and everyone in between.
                              &nbsp; I would like to share a few memories of my
                              early childhood that I hope you will find
                              interesting.
                            </p>
                            <p class="style12">
                              When we moved to our home on Eureka I remember how
                              Mama loved her new home.&nbsp; I have a memory of
                              a cool, sunny, spring day. Mama loved to have all
                              the windows open so breezes were filling our house
                              with the freshness of spring.&nbsp; Mama would
                              clean the house from top to bottom, inside and
                              out. &nbsp; You know that feeling we get in the
                              spring. &nbsp; Well I remember white sheets and
                              diapers on the line, all the windows getting
                              scrubbed and the hardwood floors are a story of
                              their own.&nbsp; Mama would get old sweaters and
                              flannel shirts and we got on our knees with old
                              Johnson's paste wax and it seemed like we spent
                              hours buffing that floor until the shine was
                              perfect for her. &nbsp; One of my jobs was folding
                              all those bright white diapers. &nbsp; That was an
                              easy job. &nbsp; I must try to tell you what Mama
                              went through on wash day.
                            </p>
                            <p class="style12">
                              I remember because I had to help.&nbsp; There was
                              this washing machine, which was sitting just at
                              the bottom of the back steps. &nbsp; We didn't
                              have hot water at the time.&nbsp; I believe there
                              was a hose that was connected to run the cold
                              water in. &nbsp; There also were two large metal
                              tubs for rinsing. &nbsp; Hot water was heated on
                              the stove and then carried to the washing machine.
                              &nbsp; Of course, Mama started with the white
                              clothes because I don't think she changed the
                              water with every load.&nbsp; But since she put
                              &quot;bluing&quot; into the water as a whitening
                              agent she had to change the water for colored
                              clothes. &nbsp; This was a ringer type washer, so
                              you took the clothes from the hot water; Mama had
                              an old broom handle cut about three feet long to
                              help get the clothes from this hot water.&nbsp;
                              Then you put each piece through the ringer and put
                              them into the first tub of cold water. &nbsp; You
                              ring the clothes by hand and put them into the
                              second rinse. &nbsp; Then the clothes were hung on
                              the clothes line. Wash day was a very hard day,
                              but to Mama the washer was a blessing because she
                              remembered doing it all by hand on a wash board.
                              &nbsp; Of all the inventions since 1950 and boy
                              there were many to help around the house, I would
                              say the electric washer and dryer are the most
                              helpful.&nbsp; Just think we now just sort the
                              clothes, put a load into the washer and walk away
                              to do something else until the washer is through
                              then we put the clothes into the dryer and again
                              do something else until the dryer bell goes off.
                              &nbsp; It's no wonder we hate to fold clothes
                              these days. &nbsp; It's the hardest thing we do on
                              wash day.
                            </p>
                            <p class="style12">
                              Another fond memory was sitting on the front steps
                              waiting for Daddy to come home.&nbsp; Until 1949
                              there were no houses going up the hill to Fair
                              Ave. &nbsp; So you could see all the way up the
                              hill. Daddy was working at Handy Andy on Highland
                              Blvd. at the time. &nbsp; There weren't many cars
                              coming down the hill. Mama would tell us to go
                              watch for Daddy.&nbsp; Recently it hit me!&nbsp;
                              What a perfect way to get kids out of your hair
                              while you are making dinner.&nbsp; To us it was a
                              very special time of the day.
